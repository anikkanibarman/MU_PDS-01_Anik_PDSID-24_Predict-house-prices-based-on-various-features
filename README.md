# Regression Analysis with Python

### This project is an end-to-end regression analysis pipeline using Python and machine learning libraries.
The primary objective is to predict housing prices based on various features, leveraging the California Housing Dataset from Scikit-Learn.
It covers all major steps, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

11. Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate regression analysis using Python and popular data science libraries.
By predicting housing prices based on multiple features, we can understand and evaluate the effectiveness of different regression models.

**Dataset
**
California Housing Dataset: This dataset provides various features about California neighborhoods, including average rooms per dwelling, median income, and more. The goal is to predict the median house value for each block group.
Source: Available through Scikit-Learn.

### **Requirements:**

## Python 3.x

## Libraries:

## scikit-learn

## pandas

## numpy

## matplotlib

## seaborn


# Key Steps :

Setup and Imports: Import libraries including Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

**Data Loading and EDA:**

Load the California Housing dataset using Scikit-Learn.
Conduct exploratory analysis, including feature distribution and correlation analysis.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Handle any missing values and scale features.
Split data into training and test sets.

**Model Training:**
Train a Linear Regression model. Alternatives like Random Forest can also be used.

**Evaluation and Metrics:**
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Perform k-fold cross-validation to assess model generalizability.

**Visualization of Results:**
Plot actual vs. predicted values for visual analysis of model performance.

# **Future Work**

Experiment with other regression algorithms (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, RandomForestRegressor).
Hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
Feature engineering and selection to refine the model.
